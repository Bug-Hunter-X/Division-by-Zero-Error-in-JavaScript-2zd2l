# Division by Zero Error in JavaScript

This repository contains a JavaScript code example that demonstrates a common error: division by zero.  The `foo` function attempts to divide two numbers, but it doesn't handle the case where the denominator is zero, resulting in an error.

The solution provided handles this edge case gracefully, preventing the error.
